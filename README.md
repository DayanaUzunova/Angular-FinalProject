# Angular-FinalProject
This is my final project with Angular.
## Project Description:
The Courses Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to streamline the process of managing and interacting with educational courses. It provides a user-friendly platform for creating, viewing, updating, deleting, and searching courses. The platform allows users to easily learn more about something they are interested in. Every course has details. There is a search box where users can search for a course they want to learn about. The project is still in progress. The system is built with modern web technologies, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and a seamless user experience.
